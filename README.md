The Black-Scholes model is a widely used mathematical formula for pricing options. It takes into account factors such as the underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. This model helps traders and investors determine the fair value of options and assess potential risks and rewards. It has applications in option trading, risk management, investment valuation, and financial research. Despite its assumptions and limitations, the Black-Scholes model remains a fundamental tool in option pricing and has greatly influenced the field of quantitative finance.
